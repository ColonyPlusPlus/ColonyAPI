# ColonyAPI

## Using the API

Simply include the API as a reference for your mod, then use its functionality via the `ColonyAPI` namespace. You can find examples of mods in the Examples folder.

## Building the API

You will need to add the following files from your `Colony Survival/colonyserver_Data/Managed` folder:

- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- UnityEngine.dll
- UnityEngine.UI.dll

And `APIProvider.dll` from `Colony Survival/gamedata/mods/Pipliz/APIProvider`
